# Week 3: Personal Profile Card - Study Notes

**Name: Haiyang Li**

## Understanding Variables and Data Types

**What are the four main data types you used in this assignment?**
[List string, int, double, and bool - explain what each stores and give examples from your profile card]

Answer:string , int , double, bool

**Why did you use `double` for GPA instead of `int`?**
[Explain the difference and why decimal precision matters for GPA]

Answer:cause GPA is average of the total grades

**How did you convert the yes/no input into a boolean?**
[Explain the comparison operation you used]

Answer: use result == "yes" straight to assignment to the bool variable

## Data Modeling Decisions

**How did you organize the information into logical groups?**
[Explain why you grouped certain pieces of information together (personal, academic, etc.)]

Answer:Personal attribute is belong the people, the academic is from the effort, and extra information including the habbit, favorite, interesting things

**Which pieces of information did you calculate rather than ask for?**
[List the derived data: birth year, years to graduation, height conversion, honor status, age in months]

Answer:

**Why is it better to calculate birth year from age rather than ask for both?**
[Explain data consistency and reducing redundant input]

Answer: using the day of now minus the age.

## Challenges and Solutions

**Biggest challenge with this assignment:**
[What was the hardest part? Type conversion, calculations, formatting, choosing data types?]

Answer: I don't feel hardest part. If has, is convert height.

**How you solved it:**
[Explain your approach to overcoming the challenge]

Answer:

**Most confusing concept:**
[What was hardest to understand? Type casting, modulus for height, boolean logic, or formatting?]

Answer:

## Type Conversion and Calculations

**How do you convert string input to a number?**
[Explain Parse methods: int.Parse(), double.Parse()]

Answer:int.parse()

**What calculation did you use to convert height from inches to feet and inches?**
[Explain: feet = inches / 12, remaining = inches % 12]

Answer:height / 30.48 for Feet,
       height / 2.54 for Inches

**How did you determine if someone is an honor student?**
[Explain the boolean comparison: gpa >= 3.5]

Answer: the gpa >= 3.5

## Output Formatting

**How did you format the GPA to show exactly 2 decimal places?**
[Explain the :F2 format specifier]

Answer:

**How did you display different text based on whether someone is full-time or part-time?**
[Explain the conditional/ternary operator you used]

Answer:

**What techniques did you use to make the output look organized?**
[Discuss alignment, spacing, section headers, borders]

Answer:

## Real-World Data Modeling

**What other calculated fields could you add to a profile?**
[Think of other derived data: BMI from height/weight, time to birthday, etc.]

Answer:

**Why is choosing the right data type important in real applications?**
[Explain memory, precision, and type safety]

Answer:

**How does this profile card relate to real-world applications?**
[Think about social media profiles, job applications, student records systems]

Answer:

## What I Learned

**Key takeaways from this week:**
[What are the 3-5 most important things you learned about variables and data modeling?]

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

**Which data type was most challenging to work with and why?**
[Reflect on your experience with string, int, double, or bool]

Answer:

**How does understanding data types help you write better programs?**
[Explain the benefits of type safety and appropriate data representation]

Answer:

## Testing and Debugging

**What test cases did you use to verify your calculations?**
[List different inputs you tested - edge cases, typical values, etc.]

Answer:

**What bugs or errors did you encounter and fix?**
[Describe any type conversion errors, calculation mistakes, or formatting issues]

Answer:

**How did you validate that your data types were correct?**
[Explain how you checked that GPA, heights, ages worked correctly]

Answer:

## Time Spent

**Total time:** [3 hours]

**Breakdown:**

-   Understanding data types and planning variables: [0.2 hours]
-   Collecting user input with correct types: [0.2 hours]
-   Implementing calculations: [1 hours]
-   Formatting output: [0.2 hours]
-   Testing and debugging: [0.2 hours]
-   Writing documentation: [1 hours]

**Most time-consuming part:** [Which aspect took the longest and why?]

Answer:

## Reflection

**What would you do differently if you started over?**
[Consider variable names, calculation order, organization, etc.]

Answer:

**How does proper data modeling make programs easier to maintain?**
[Think about readability, consistency, and reducing errors]

Answer:

**What real-world system would you like to model next?**
[Shopping cart, game character, recipe calculator, etc.]

Answer:game character.
